# Agent Customization

!!! note "Work in Progress"
    This page is currently under development.

## Overview

This tutorial guides you through the process of customizing an agent with advanced functionality, including integration with external APIs, handling complex prompts, and implementing custom logic.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have:

- Completed the [Deploy Your First Agent](../getting-started/first-agent.md) guide
- Basic understanding of Python and Docker
- AWS credentials properly configured

## Basic Agent Structure

A standard agent consists of:

1. **Dockerfile** - Defines the container environment
2. **app.py** - Contains the agent's logic
3. **requirements.txt** - Lists Python dependencies

## Adding External API Integration

To integrate with external APIs:

```python
# Example code will be added in a future update
```

## Implementing Custom Logic

Add custom logic to your agent:

```python
# Example code will be added in a future update
```

## Handling Complex Prompts

Process structured prompts:

```python
# Example code will be added in a future update
```

## Advanced Configuration

Configure advanced options:

```python
# Example code will be added in a future update
```

## Deployment and Testing

Deploy and test your customized agent:

```bash
# Example commands will be added in a future update
```

## Best Practices

Guidelines for agent customization will be added in a future update.
