# Environment-First Design

!!! note "Work in Progress"
    This page is currently under development.

## Overview

Environment-first design is a core architectural principle of AgentCore CLI that ensures complete separation between development, staging, and production environments.

## Key Concepts

- **Environment Isolation**: Each environment maintains its own resources
- **Regional Deployment**: Different AWS regions per environment
- **Independent Configuration**: Environment-specific settings
- **Access Controls**: Environment-specific authentication and authorization

## Benefits

1. **Development Safety**: Changes to development don't impact production
2. **Testing Confidence**: Staging exactly mirrors production architecture
3. **Regional Compliance**: Deploy to regions that meet compliance requirements
4. **Disaster Recovery**: Multiple region support for failover scenarios

## Implementation

Details on how environment-first design is implemented in AgentCore CLI will be added in a future update.

## Best Practices

Recommended patterns for working with environments will be covered in a future update.
