# Security Model

!!! note "Work in Progress"
    This page is currently under development.

## Overview

The AgentCore CLI implements a comprehensive security model that focuses on least privilege, identity management, environment isolation, and secure deployment practices.

## Key Security Components

### IAM Role Management

- **Least Privilege**: Each agent gets only the permissions it needs
- **Role Policies**: Auto-generated IAM policies based on agent requirements
- **Role Separation**: Different roles for different environments

### Cognito Authentication

- **User Management**: Integrated user registration and authentication
- **Identity Pools**: Secure token-based access
- **Federation**: Support for enterprise identity providers

### Environment Isolation

- **Security Boundaries**: Strict separation between environments
- **Region-Specific Resources**: Resources isolated by AWS region
- **Access Control**: Environment-specific access policies

### Session Isolation

- **Dedicated microVMs**: Isolated CPU, memory, and filesystem resources
- **Resource Constraints**: Memory and timeout limits
- **Runtime Security**: AWS Bedrock AgentCore Runtime security protections

## Best Practices

Recommended security practices when working with AgentCore CLI will be covered in a future update.

## Security Recommendations

Guidelines for securing your agents and deployments will be added in a future update.
